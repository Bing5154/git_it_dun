Rules:
Object: 
The object of the game is to capture all of your opponenet's checkers or block them, so they cannot move. 

Start:
Checkers are placed on the black squares of the first three rows of each side of the board.

Play:
Checkers can be moved diagonally only, foward only, and one move only. Jumping/capturing opponenet's checker(s) can be done if there are vaccant squares behind each. If the checker reaches the last row of your opponenet's side, then it has become a king. Kings are like checkers, but can move foward and backward.
