todo.txt file - Our To-Do List

1) Add swapping as methods of Board.java to represent movement
2) Implement force jumping.

3) Write the actual chckers part into the code as in an iteration, including an end to the game and players switching turns.

4) Debug at this point and make sure we have MVP.
5) Make sure pieces turn into a king upon reaching the other side of the board.
6) Test the game and further debug.
7) Add strings to make sure a user will know what they're doing.
8) Have the scores of the number of moves to win saved into a text file and updated as users run the code.

9) Add strings to improve the user experience and make the design easier to understand.
